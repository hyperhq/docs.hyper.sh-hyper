## Fees for Use of the Hyper.sh Services

- `4.1` Subject to the Terms, the Hyper.sh Services is provided to you without charge up to certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services.

You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees Hyper.sh incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Hyper.sh’s measurements of your use of the Hyper.sh Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Hyper.sh and only in the form of credit for the Hyper.sh Services.
